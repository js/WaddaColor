# WaddaColor

Swift library for a naming a color, based on a closest match to the colors in
Ingrid Sundbergs [Color Thesaurus](http://ingridsundberg.com/2014/02/04/the-color-thesaurus/).

Just give it any color and it will return the name of that color, and what a color it is.

## Usage

Via the UIColor extention:

	UIColor.blackColor().name // Black

or via a `WaddaColor` instance:

    let wadda = WaddaColor(color: UIColor.orange())
    let match = wadda.closestMatch()
    return match.name // Tangerine

## Example app

The Xcode project contains a sample app target called WhatTheColor
